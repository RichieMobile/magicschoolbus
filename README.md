# magicschoolbus

Magicschoolbus picks up files matching a configured patten from a source directory to a destination directory. An example of when it might be used is if you download a recipient and a ticket to your Downloads directory and then need them moved to separate sub folders.

## Usage

Edit the config.json file to add new stops. Then run magicschoolbus from cli:

    $ java -jar magicschoolbus-0.0.01-alpha.jar
